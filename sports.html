<h3>Journey to a Healthier Self: The Role of Sports and Fitness in My Life</h3>
<p>
  You may be surprised to find this section on my website, but it serves as a
  testament to the important role sports have played in shaping who I am today.
</p>
<p>
  Team sports from a young age taught me valuable lessons in discipline,
  companionship, responsibility, and leadership. Though I had to set it aside
  during the first few years of my career, returning to indoor soccer in
  university showed me the benefits of physical activity not only on my mental
  health, but also on my academic performance.

  Three years ago, I shifted my focus towards fitness and gym training. However,
  as someone who has always been driven to compete and challenge myself in
  sports, I decided to start training for
  <b>OCR (Obstacle Course Racing) events</b> like the Spartan Race, which
  demands both strength and endurance.

<p>
  With the aim of continuing to push myself physically and mentally, my current
  focus is on <b>triathlons</b>, a sport that allows me to constantly test my
  limits and improve my performance. In just four months of training, on October
  2022, I won the Barcelona Triathlon in the SuperSprint distance (350m swim,
  10km bike ride and 2.5km run). This season I am challenging myself to compete
  in the Sprint distance (750m, 20km, 5km), keeping in mind the objective of
  progressing and gradually working towards the ultimate ambition of
  participating in an IRONMAN event that involves a 4km swim, a 180km bike ride,
  and a 42km run.
