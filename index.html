      <p>
        My area of expertise and research lies in Deep Reinforcement Learning
        applied to industrial processes and robotics. As part of my research, I
        believe it is crucial to reflect on the ethical implications that arise
        from the implementation and utilization of these AI techniques.
        <br \ />
        <br \ />
        In addition to my professional pursuits, I am an enthusiastic triathlete
        who recognizes and appreciates the importance of maintaining a balance
        between work and physical fitness.
        <br \ />
        This combination of skills and interests allows me to bring a unique
        perspective and dedication to my work that is both well-rounded and
        driven.

      <h2>Ph.D. Thesis Topic</h2>
      <p>
        My Ph.D. ultimate aim is to suggest a solution that can efficiently
        address the transfer knowledge problem between a deep reinforcement
        learning agent trained in a virtual environment and another one deployed
        in a real environment. The industrial assets we are using to test the
        algorithms are two roboic arms, the IRB120 (ABB) and the UR3e (Universal
        Robots).

        I have been involved in multiple projects as a research assistant for
        prominent companies in the industrial sector. These projects encompass a
        wide range of subject matters, including data analysis, the application
        of machine learning and deep learning techniques to resolve quality
        issues, as well as the development of integrated control systems and
        classical computer vision for mobile robots.

      <h2>Sports and fitness</h2>
      <p>
        Sports have always been a big part of my life, from playing soccer,
        volleyball or golf to taking up OCR races as the Spartan Race. It wasn't
        until last year that I discovered my enthusiasm for triathlon. Since
        then, I have been training rigorously and participating in races
        regularly. I am proud to have won the Barcelona SuperSprint Championship
        in October 2022, but I know that there is still a lot of room for
        improvement. My ultimate goal is to finish an IRONMAN Race, and I am
        determined to keep pushing myself to achieve this dream.

          For two consecutive years (since 2020), I have been elected as the representative of research assistants at
          the Institute for Research in Technology (IIT). My responsibility is to advocate for the interests of research
          assistants and communicate their concerns to the IIT Board of Directors. I am also a link between senior
          researchers and junior assistants, ensuring that everyone's voices are heard and their needs are met.
