<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) is a technology-driven revolution that seeks to transform processes,
    systems, and methods through the digitalization and interconnectivity of all assets. Smart Factories, an essential
    pillar of Industry 4.0, require the integration of multiple technologies that lead to an interoperable
    manufacturing plant where almost all components of the value network are connected, coordinated, and share data.
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the main vectors for this revoulolution, but one obstacle to its use
    in industry is that algorithms are highly "data consuming."
</p>
<p>
    Unlike other machine learning approaches that rely in a model gorund-truth dataset, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
    algorithms learn thanks to the experience gathered from the interaction of the agent with its environment. Within
    this framework, the major constraint of the application of RL to industry problems is the amount of experience an
    agent consumes until it learns.
    This <b>sample efficiency</b> issue of RL algorithms can be addressed relying on the use of virtual environments to
    train the agents. The ideal case would rely on a simulator that is an exact reproduction of the physical setup, but
    in most cases, there will be divergences between both layouts. These divergences can make agents not perform as
    expected when they are deployed in the real environment. To deal with this problem, several <b>transfer learning
        techniques</b> have been developed to bridge the gap between the real world and simulation, known as
    <b>sim-to-real</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, with this approach the sample efficiency problem is mitigated, but another one raises: <u>the need to
        efficiently transfer the synthetic experience into the real world</u>. Within this framework, my Ph.D. thesis is
    framed as <b>the search for an optimized pipeline to solve the sim-to-real problem</b>.
