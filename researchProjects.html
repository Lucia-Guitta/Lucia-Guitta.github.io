<h3>Institute for Research in Technology (IIT)</h3>
<p>Before starting my Ph.D. thesis, I have gained valuable experience working as a Research Assistant in the Smart
    Systems department of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iit.comillas.edu/index.php.en">Institute for Research
        in Technology (IIT)</a>, where I have contributed to research projects like the ones listed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>GAUDETE: model of prediction, decision-making and transfer to society against the expansion of the coronavirus
        COVID-19.</li>
    <li>Development of an tool to optimize the filling of containers and trucks.</li>
    <li>Design of the battery-recharge system of an autonomous robot.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In my initial two projects, my work centered on data analysis and processing. However, the third project delves
    into the field of classical computer vision and control. In that venture, we created an autonomous positioning
    system for a 4-wheeled robot in relation to a wireless charging station. Additionally, we conducted a sensitivity
    analysis of the charging system's performance taking into account the robot's relative position.

<h3>ICAI's Chair in Smart Industry (CIC)</h3>
<p>
    The ICAI School of Engineering, together with a group of prominent industrial and technological companies,
    established the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.comillas.edu/en/cic">Chair in Smart Industry (CIC)</a>
    in 2017. It provides a unique platform to unify studies, development, training, and dissemination efforts that
    promote the digital transformation of the Spanish industry. The primary objective is to foster discussion and
    training on significant aspects of the Smarty Industry, including Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity,
    Robotics, Supply Chain, Talent 4.0, Analytics and Big Data, and the Internet of Things.

<h4>CIC_LAB</h4>

<p>
    In order to cover all the research projects and the commercial ones developed for our sponsoring companies, the
    CIC_LAB was established. Within this framework, I work on both, our research projects contributing with my Ph.D.
    investigation, as well as co-supervising projects carried out by visiting students for our sponsoring companies.
    The projects' topics are fully aligned with the mission of the CIC. Some examples of projects where I was involved
    include:
<ul>
    <li>GAUDETE: model of prediction, decision-making and transfer to society against the expansion of the coronavirus
        COVID-19.</li>
    <li>Development of an tool to optimize the filling of containers and trucks.</li>
    <li>Design of the battery-recharge system of an autonomous robot.</li>
</ul>
